## About

This is a minigame I made inspired by a project from class

Developed using c# and unity. Includes community assets so shout out to them

The game is more arcade style. Where you go untill you run out of lives.

Game diffcutly increases as time goes on thanks to coroutines and physics stuff.

Some materials are made with AI/chat GPT
